# **Markdown Learning**
This is a personal quick-guide/reference on using Markdown.
This is meant to help me refresh my knowledge on md

I will mostly be using it in my git readme documentation amongst other applications



# The documentation
## Headings
You can put headings by using the '#' symbol before a title heading.
The more '#' you put the lower the headings get

ie 
- # This is a H1 heading with one '#'
- ## This is a H2 heading with two '#'
- ### This is a H3 heading with three '#'
- #### This is a H4 heading with four '#'
- ##### This is a H5 heading with five '#'

## Text formatting
You can put text in bold and italics, but you can not underline text in markdown.

- For **Bold** text, put your text betwen a pair of double asterisk'\*\*' signs, ie '\*\*Text\*\*' will be rendered as **Text**
- For *Italics* put your text betwen a pair of single asterisk'\*' signs, ie '\*Text\*' will be rendered as *Text*
- For both ***Bold and Italics*** put your text betwen a pair of tripple asterisk'\*' signs, ie '\*\*\*Text\*\*\*' will be rendered as ***Text***
